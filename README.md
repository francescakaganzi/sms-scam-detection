# SMS Scam Detection Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks used in a graduate research project on SMS scam detection using traditional ML, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Contents

- `final_sms_scam_eda.ipynb` – Exploratory data analysis and visualization of SMS dataset.
- `final_sms_scam_ml.ipynb` – Classical machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- `final_sms_scam_dl.ipynb` – Deep learning approaches using PyTorch.
- `final_sms_scam_llms.ipynb` – LLM fine-tuning and evaluation for scam classification.
- `final_sms_scam_llama_8b.ipynb` – Fine-tuning and inference using the LLaMA 8B model.

## Installation

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
